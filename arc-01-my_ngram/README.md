# my_ngram

## Overview

`my_ngram` is a simple C program that counts how many times a character is repeated in a string. It provides functionality similar to n-gram analysis but with a focus on individual characters.

## Features

- Counts the occurrence of each character in a given string.
- Outputs the count of each character.
- Provides a simple interface for analyzing character repetition in a string.

## Getting Started

This C program is designed to analyze the frequency of characters in a series of input strings passed through the command line arguments. It provides a simple way to count the occurrences of each character excluding double quotes ("") and then print out the results.

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Git (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
he code defines a macro VID_OBJECT_SIZE with a value of 128. It also defines three functions:

 1. my_strlen: This function calculates the length of a string.
 2. fill_array: This function fills an array with the frequency of characters found in a given string, excluding double quotes ".
 3. print_array: This function prints the contents of an array along with their frequencies.
